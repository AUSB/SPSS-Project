# SPSS-Project


Background:


DATA COLLECTION 
Choose 3 lists of 36 stocks on the TSX from http://clouddc.chass.utoronto.ca.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/ds/cfmrc/ 

Pick 36 stocks based on  

• 36 stocks whose symbols begin with Y or A (call this the 1st group)
• 36 stocks whose symbols begin with J or U (call this the 2nd group)
• 36 stocks whose symbols begin with B or A (call this the 3rd group)
and get an end of day price for ALL of them on the same date (April 6). 


RULE:
ONLY CHOOSE STOCKS that have both 2015 & 2016 prices.

Try to get a range of prices. This improves the “appearance” of the distribution. Do not use stocks that have a negative price or a zero price in either year (may select more than your total of 108 stocks because some might need to be rejected if they have zero or negative prices – end up with 108 stocks with non-zero and non-negative prices).
Get an end of day price for approximately 1 year later in 2016 (± 1-5 days) FOR FIRST & SECOND BASKETS of stocks. 



Comparing two means:
We are performing Two-Sample T-Test in SPSS.
Two-Sample T-Test is also known as independent T-Test or between-subjects T-test. We perform this test when we want to compare the mean of two different samples. 
By running Analyze/CompareMeans/ Independent-Samples T-Test, we can decide if there is a significant difference in the mean value of the sets of stocks between two group1 and group2 in 2015, at the α = 0.05 level of significance. 

Comparing 3 means:
Performing one-way ANOVA in SPSS. 
ANOVA stands for Analysis Of VAriance. We run ANOVA when we want to compare the mean scores of three or more groups.
By running Analyze/General Linear Model/Univariate in SPSS to analyze if there is a significant difference in the mean value of the sets of stocks in each of the three groups in 2015, at the α =0.05 level of significance.


Regression:

Performing simple linear regression in SPSS
We run simple linear regression when we want to access the relationship between two continuous variables.
We are running Analyze/Regression/Linear in SPSS to analyze the if the price of stocks in year 2015 were to be significant to determine the price of the stocks in year 2016. 
The stock price in 2015 is called dependent variable and the stock price that we are going to predict in 2016 is called dependent variable.
